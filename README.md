# osrs-progress

A very simple OSRS tracker to track achievements, quests, pets and collections based on unlocked skills and completed quests.

## A Brief Overview

This tool is designed to be used in conjunction with the XOSAAT playstyle, which means that skills have to be completed linearly one-by-one, with the additional rule that all available achievements, collections, pets, quests, and achievements have to also be completed.  The tool provides the ability to track all of these requirements, which have been obtained from the [wiki](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/) and stored in `assets\json`.

Built using `Jekyll`, `TailwindCSS`, `jQuery` and `JavaScript ES6`. 

## Requirements

If deploying locally, there are a few prerequisites and commands to run:

- Node/npm
- Ruby/RubyGems
- Jekyll

``` bash
npm install
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
